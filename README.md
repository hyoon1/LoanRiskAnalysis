# Loan Risk Analysis (CreValu)

## Project Overview
This project aims to precisely assess loan applications through a comprehensive risk analysis, enabling strategic decision-making in lending practices. We leverage a detailed dataset from Kaggle, which includes various attributes of borrowers and their loan details, to predict the likelihood of loan default. The objective is to minimize default risks while ensuring robust and flexible loan management.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data). It includes information such as personal income, home ownership status, loan amount, loan interest rate, and other relevant financial attributes.
